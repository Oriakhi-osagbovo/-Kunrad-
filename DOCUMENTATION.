1. Using Bash scripts, to Ubuntu systems designated as 'Master' and 'Slave' were deployed. The Master Node was configured to act as a control system, while the Slave Node was configured to be managed by the Master node.
2. Infrastructure Configuration: Two Ubuntu systems were deployed, 
* Master Node: This node would act as a control system for the Slave Node. 
* Slave Node: This node would be managed by the Master node.
3. User Management: On the Master node, a user named Altschool was created  and granted user root (superuser) privileges. 
4. Inter-node Communication: Next, SSH key-based authentication was enabled so that the Master node (Altschool user) would seamlessly SSH into the Slave node without requiring a password. 
5. Data Management and Transfer: On initiation, the script was set to copy the contents of /mnt/altschool directory from the Master node to /mnt/altschool/slave on the Slave node. This operation would be performed using the Altschool user from the Master node.
6. Process Monitoring: The Master node was then set to  display an overview of the Linux process management, showcasing currently running processes.
7.  LAMP Stack Deployment: Finally, 
* AMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack was then installed on both nodes.
* Apache was set to  run and to start on boot. 
* MySQL installation was then secured and initialized with a default user and password.
* PHP functionality with Apache was then validated.
